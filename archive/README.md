# Archive of Collection of Bash Scripts for Mac OS

These are archived scripts that I donâ€™t use anymore. Mainly because of the aging of versions (like scripts that are specific for Tomcat 6).

## Scripts for Updates on Tomcat 6
    ./deploy-many-wars-from-file-on-tomcat6.sh
    ./deploy-new-war-on-tomcat6.sh
    functions-for-deploying-on-tomcat6.sh.sh
